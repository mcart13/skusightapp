# Active Context: SKU Sight

## Current Work Focus

### Project Initialization
The project is currently in the initial setup phase. We have established the Memory Bank documentation system to maintain context and knowledge about the SKU Sight application. This documentation will serve as the source of truth for the project's requirements, architecture, and progress.

### Documentation Setup
The Memory Bank has been created with the following core files:
- `projectbrief.md`: Defining core requirements and goals
- `productContext.md`: Explaining why the project exists and how it should work
- `systemPatterns.md`: Documenting system architecture and design patterns
- `techContext.md`: Detailing technologies and technical constraints
- `activeContext.md`: This file, tracking current focus and next steps
- `progress.md`: Will track what works and what's left to build

### Current Development Status
The project appears to be a Shopify app built with the Remix framework. The basic structure is in place with:
- Frontend components organized by feature (Sales Analysis, Order Automation, Settings)
- Routes for different app sections
- Service layer for business logic
- Database setup with Prisma
- Integration with Shopify's APIs

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Establishment
- Created the memory-bank directory
- Initialized all core documentation files
- Documented project requirements and architecture
- Established technical context and constraints

### Project Structure Analysis
- Analyzed the existing component structure
- Identified key service modules
- Mapped out the application routes
- Understood the data flow patterns

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**
   - Create the `progress.md` file to track development status
   - Create the `.clinerules` file for project-specific patterns
   - Review all documentation for consistency and completeness

2. **Project Familiarization**
   - Deeper exploration of key components
   - Review of critical business logic in services
   - Understanding of data models and relationships
   - Analysis of API integration points

3. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Ensure local development environment is properly configured
   - Verify database setup and migrations
   - Test Shopify integration and authentication
   - Confirm webhook handling functionality

### Short-term Goals
1. **Feature Assessment**
   - Evaluate the completeness of each major feature
   - Identify any gaps in functionality
   - Prioritize remaining development work
   - Document feature-specific requirements

2. **Code Quality Review**
   - Assess code organization and structure
   - Identify opportunities for refactoring
   - Ensure consistent patterns across the codebase
   - Verify error handling and edge cases

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review database query patterns
   - Assess caching implementation
   - Evaluate frontend performance
   - Identify bottlenecks in data processing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component Organization**: The application uses a feature-based component organization, which should be maintained for consistency.
- **State Management**: Server-side state management with Remix is the primary approach, with minimal client-side state.
- **Data Access Patterns**: Services abstract data access, providing a clean separation of concerns.
- **Error Handling**: A structured approach to error handling is in place and should be followed.

### Technical Considerations
- **Database Schema**: The current schema supports the core functionality but may need extension for new features.
- **API Integration**: Shopify's GraphQL API is the primary integration point, with REST as a fallback.
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis is used for caching to improve performance and reduce API calls.
- **Authentication**: Shopify OAuth is used for authentication, with session management handled by the app.
- **App Bridge Integration**: As an embedded app, App Bridge is essential for navigation, UI components, and communication with Shopify Admin.

### UX Considerations
- **Consistency**: All UI components should follow Shopify's Polaris design system.
- **Performance**: User interactions should be responsive, with appropriate loading states.
- **Error Feedback**: Users should receive clear feedback when errors occur.
- **Data Visualization**: Complex data should be presented in an intuitive, actionable format.

### Open Questions
- What is the current test coverage for the application?
- Are there any known performance issues that need addressing?
- What is the deployment strategy for production releases?
- How are feature flags managed for progressive rollouts?
- What monitoring and alerting is in place for production?
- How are App Bridge version updates managed and tested?

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- Ensuring efficient data processing for stores with large product catalogs
- Managing Shopify API rate limits for data-intensive operations
- Implementing effective caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Balancing server-side and client-side rendering for optimal performance
- Maintaining proper App Bridge integration as Shopify updates their Admin UI

### Product Challenges
- Providing actionable insights that deliver real value to merchants
- Creating an intuitive interface for complex data analysis
- Ensuring accuracy in inventory and sales predictions
- Balancing feature richness with simplicity of use

### Process Challenges
- Maintaining comprehensive documentation as the project evolves
- Ensuring consistent implementation of design patterns
- Coordinating frontend and backend development efforts
- Managing Shopify platform changes and updates
