# Product Context: SKU Sight

## Why This Project Exists

### Market Need
Shopify merchants face significant challenges in inventory management, sales analysis, and order automation. Many existing solutions are either too complex, too expensive, or don't integrate well with Shopify. SKU Sight fills this gap by providing an integrated, user-friendly solution specifically designed for Shopify merchants.

### Merchant Pain Points
1. **Inventory Management Challenges**
   - Difficulty tracking inventory levels across multiple products
   - Inability to predict when to reorder stock
   - Challenges in identifying slow-moving inventory
   - Lack of insights into inventory turnover rates

2. **Sales Analysis Limitations**
   - Limited built-in analytics in Shopify
   - Difficulty connecting sales data to inventory decisions
   - Time-consuming manual analysis of sales trends
   - Lack of actionable insights from raw sales data

3. **Order Process Inefficiencies**
   - Manual reordering processes are time-consuming
   - Inconsistent supplier management
   - Difficulty tracking order history and patterns
   - No automation for routine reordering

## Problems It Solves

### Inventory Optimization
SKU Sight helps merchants maintain optimal inventory levels by analyzing sales patterns, identifying trends, and providing recommendations for reordering. This reduces both stockouts (lost sales) and overstock (tied-up capital).

### Data-Driven Decision Making
By providing clear, actionable insights based on sales and inventory data, SKU Sight enables merchants to make informed decisions about product assortment, pricing, and purchasing.

### Operational Efficiency
The order automation features streamline the reordering process, saving merchants time and reducing errors in manual ordering processes.

### Performance Visibility
System monitoring and logging features provide transparency into app operations, helping merchants and support staff troubleshoot issues and ensure optimal performance.
